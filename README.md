## Licensing
This isn't included formally in the current revision of the LICENSE document, but as a courtesy, I will note that this repo is licensed under the MIT license and the CC0 license. The CC0 license is the current license; however, as the MIT license is irrevocable, I'll note that as a courtesy.

Oh, but you might say, "you can revoke the MIT license as long as you're in the US and provide a notice to the copyright office", yada yada yada. Sure. Two problems with that: I'm not in the US (suprise!), and I don't really care about this magnificent work of flaming garbage. There.
